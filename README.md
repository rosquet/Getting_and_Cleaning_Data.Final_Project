# Final Project: JHU Getting and Cleaning Data

This is the repository for the final project of the above-mentioned course.

## Purpose

The project tasks the student with taking a large data set and transforming 
it into tidy data. Once this is done, analysis is performed.

## Modifications to run_analysis.R

Lines 32-35 may have to be modified to reflect the OS and directory structure
of its new environment.

## Project Goals

<br>
<ol>
<li>Merge the training and test sets into one data set</li>
<li>Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set</li>
<li>Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names</li>
<li>From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ol>
